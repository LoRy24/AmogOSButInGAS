# AmogOSButInGAS
An Operating System made with &lt;3 and with GAS, the hardest ASSEMBLY Syntax of all the world. Harder than machine code, chinese language, brainfuck etc.

NOTE: For a better understanding of the code, you should use a better text editor like VS Code. GitHub seems to don't like tabulations... Have fun ;)
